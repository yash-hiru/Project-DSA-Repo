## Coding interview

### OVERVIEW

- Paper pen ==> Allowed but CHECK with interviewer, Avoid if you can to save time
- Editor => Same as collabedit
- Libraries => ASK and use if he/she is OK
- Get well versed with time, space complexity and recurrence relation.
- Process mostly same as Amazon

### Actual Tips

#### PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING (3-5 Mins)

- Understand Problem by asking clarification questions
- Clarify assumptions
- Write examples..Don't get coaching..Be self driven
- Think a loud
- Objective and to the coord answers.
- 45 mins time is precious..DONT waste on irrelevant discussions.

#### DISCUSS APPROACH (SOLUTIONS) (5-10 mins)

- DO discuss approaches with tradeoff
- AVOID wasting time on over-communication and irrelevant details.  (e.g. discussing brute force appraoch in detail even
  though optimal approach is there.)
- BE CONFIDENT on PROPOSAL and GET BUY IN for OPTIMAL approach.
- DO think on generalizing (e.g. taking K for fixed set of inputs than hardcoding them)
- DO Trade offs with time-space complexities. Recurrent relation as applicable.
- ```[Still keep possibility open for even further for further optimization.]```

#### IMPLEMENTATION--- (15-20 Mins)

- DO Implement agreed upon approach ONLY
- DONT seek for hint
- DONT miss edge case
- WRITE Core working function than outline classes and other utilities.
- DATA TYPE-- Int vs Long ( big size solutions), see if overflow/underflow etc.
- Self Review
- DON'T Read code while writing
- CODE revision1 and THEN EXPLAIN -- Ask for 10 mins for coding if that works

#### [Optional] REFACTORING(NICE to have)--- ( 10 mins)

- Refactor (Initial function --> class --> Refactoring --> Assume TODOs)

#### DRY RUN (5-10 mins)

- DRYRUN implementation
- FIX edge cases, bugs etc. without any help
